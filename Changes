Revision history for Perl extension Bryar.

3.0 - 2007-01-20
    - First release by new maintainer David Cantrell
    - Comments now accept an 'email' field from the user
    - The default Template Toolkit renderer has a lot more of TT's options
      turned on to support more complex templates
    - For the FlatFile datasource *only* (but this is the default source):
      - journal entries whose files' timestamps are in the future are
        'embargoed'
      - you *must* specify your email address so you can be notified of
        comments
      - comments are emailed to the journal's owner by shelling out to the
        'mail' program
      - comments are now subject to a crude spam filter:
        - the string 'http://' appearing three or more times is presumed to
          be spam, and the comment is simply thrown away
        - the string 'http://' appearing one or two times means the comment
          might be spam and the journal's owner is emailed so he can decide
          whether to add it to the *.comments file by hand or not
