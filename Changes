Revision history for Perl extension Bryar.

4.0 - 2009-10-25
    - First release by new maintainer Marco d'Itri.
    - Fixed and improved the calendar template.
    - Removed debugging statements from posts_calendar().
    - Added support for FastCGI using CGI::Fast.
    - Use croak instead of exit in report_error() or FastCGI processes will die.
    - Made report_error() return status 500.
    - HTML-escape the text output by report_error().
    - Added a Renderer class which generates a Google sitemap using
      WWW::Google::SiteMap.
    - Use Template::Provider::Encoding to support non-ASCII posts.
    - Moved the Template Toolkit macros to a common file.
    - Added the ".tt2" extension to the calendar template.
    - Added macros to print DateTime objects as ISO 8601 and RFC 822 strings.
    - Updated the ATOM template to the 1.0 format.
    - Added a Bryar::Document::url() method useful in templates to get the
      relative URL of posts.
    - Fixed the permalinks when categories are used.
    - Added support to generate arbitrary HTTP headers. Templates can modify
      them by manipulating the bryar.http_headers hash.
    - Added support for caching the formatted pages using Cache::Cache.
    - Return a 404 error when no posts matching the parameters are available.
    - Treat all input and output streams as UTF-8.
    - Added to the URL parser support for requesting posts older than a certain
      date, using the format /before_<timestamp>. Updated the HTML template.
    - Cleaned up the default templates.
    - Removed from the Template::Toolkit environment the "recent" and "archive"
      variables. They are undocumented, not used in the example template and
      cost two extra runs of the collector.
    - HTML-escape errors reported by Template::Toolkit.
    - Added support for the If-Modified-Since HTTP validator.
    - Instantiate the renderer/source/collector/frontend classes if they have
      a constructor.
    - Ignore commented and empty lines in the configuration file.
    - Made the FlatFile data source not automatically replace a double \n
      with a <p> tag. This is an incompatible change.
    - Replaced some uses of die with report_error().
    - Optimization: cut two stat(2) calls from each call to make_document().
    - Optimization: cache getpwuid(3) calls because they parse /etc/passwd
      every time.
    - Example: render new posts as text and post them to a newsgroup.
    - Example: fastcgi daemon with a lighttpd configuration.
    - Example: a simple WYSIWYG editor for posts, based on fckeditor.

    - remote execution bug fixed

3.0 - 2007-01-20
    - First release by new maintainer David Cantrell
    - Comments now accept an 'email' field from the user
    - The default Template Toolkit renderer has a lot more of TT's options
      turned on to support more complex templates
    - For the FlatFile datasource *only* (but this is the default source):
      - journal entries whose files' timestamps are in the future are
        'embargoed'
      - you *must* specify your email address so you can be notified of
        comments
      - comments are emailed to the journal's owner by shelling out to the
        'mail' program
      - comments are now subject to a crude spam filter:
        - the string 'http://' appearing three or more times is presumed to
          be spam, and the comment is simply thrown away
        - the string 'http://' appearing one or two times means the comment
          might be spam and the journal's owner is emailed so he can decide
          whether to add it to the *.comments file by hand or not
